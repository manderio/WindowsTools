## WindowsTools
You have found your way to my little administrative tools repo! Welcome welcome!

Currently I got two tools here, but I am planning to add more. Each tool are meant for administrative deployment and they can be found in their respective folder. For the purpose of keeping this ReadMe as clean as possible, I have split it up so that each tool got its own readme.

### What can I find here?
- [AppDeploySortTool](AppDeploySortTool/README.md), a tool that will sort up MSI/EXE files into the correct folders for the AppDeployToolkit
- [IntuneWinConvertionTool](IntuneTool/README.md), a tool that will use the IntuneWinAppUtil on a group of folders rather than you having to input it all individually 

### What else are you working on?
- Setup module for powershell with additional administrative features I am missing from native powershell

#### Can I be helpful?
If you are nice enough, and you wish to contribute, feel free to improve on anything and open up a PR. 

#### Did you write all of this?
No, the AppDeployToolkit can be found [here](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit). And the IntuneWinAppUtil can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool). I don't own any of those pieces of software.
