## Tool for automatic creation of file.intunewin
This is a tool written to automate the process of files with the .intunewin ending. It is made because I got tired of migrating things manually. Please enjoy. 

### Important
Before you begin, this script is designed to be run for files configured with the AppDeployToolkit. **I will not give detailed instructions as to how you can edit the script to make it general, but feel free to fork and modify the script as much as you like**. In order to prepare several app deployment toolkit deployments at once, please refer to the AppDeploySort tools, you can find out more here. 

### Usage
- Rename your AppDeployToolkit folders, for example, the toolkit folder you are using in order to deploy firefox should be renamed to firefox and so on. 
- Place all your finished folders in the Applications folder. Make sure that you remove any old folders before starting the script. 
- Run the script, all finished .intunewin files can be found in the Done folder. 

### FAQ
**I am having issues related to the .exe file included, why??**
I am not the writer nor the provider of the exe included. If you have issues, you can always try and download and replace it with the latest release which can be found [here](https://github.com/PSAppDeployToolkit/PSAppDeployToolkit). I have no afilliation with this project, for the love of god, don't screech at Microsoft about my dumbass, thank you.
